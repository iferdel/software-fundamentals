ðŸ›  Software Fundamentals

Personal Repo for applying idea of repeating same idea multiple times to gain mastery...

## Thought Process
Back in the day I played Dota and Dota2. Most of the time I used different heroes between matches and it felt great but at the end of the day I was not retaining any 'knowledge' or wisdom around the correct usage of a specific hero.
Then I watched a pro twitch's transmission and he was playing with the same heroe multiple times in a row. Actually A LOT.
I tried that pattern and actually everything shifted and my overall skills increased remarkbly.

## Pattern
I think that pattern is also transferable over other topics, thus I'm planning to apply it to software fundamentals in this manner:
  - Select a concept I want to acquire knowledge from a topic like 'algorithms', for example binary searches
  - Start with first iteration, this is the most open iteration of all
  - Follow up with a second iteration, this time applying almost the same as the first iteration but starting with the tests
  - Go with third iteration, this time not only the initialization would be with tests but also with another 'colour' or 'spice' like more complexity or needs, constraints, etc.
  - From fourth up to 'who knows' the idea is to go free for all. Write whatever, we can go back to a more basic implementation (like similar to first or second iteration) but with a more 'elegant' pattern

In the process of identifying concepts and applying them, I've had to search for different sources such as:
